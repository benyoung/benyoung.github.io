# Ingredients
- cake
	- 6 large eggs separated
	- 1 cup (200 g) granulated sugar 
	- 1.5 cups (180 g) cake flour
- custard
	- 568ml milk
	- 2tbsp sugar
	- 3tbsp custard powder
- Marionberries
- 1 jar marionberry jam
- 500ml whip cream
- maraschino cherries
- brandy or port

# instructions

- make the sponge cake and cool it 
- thaw marionberries. defrost amount comparable to cake volume
- spread jam on the cake, then cut cake into fingers/sticks/thin wedges
- whip entire 500ml carton of cream
- make custard: the recipe on the side of Bird's custard powder but with 1.5 times the custard powder. easier if you DON'T let it set up completely and it's still pourable, but not so hot that it'll mess with the whip cream.
- Put it in a tall glass cylinder for tasty-lookin', in layers: cake/ jam, berries, "some" alcohol (soak cake), custard, whip cream. Mostly just try to make it look cool.
- for tall thin trifle receptacle, you can get 3 or 4 layers so try to do that.  Looks cooler.
- Decorate the top with maraschino cherries.
