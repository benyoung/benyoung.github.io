# About me

I'm a mathematician at the University of Oregon.  I work in algebraic and enumerative combinatorics.  A large part of my work involves combinatorics of the dimer model.  I have also done some work in the combinatorial side of Schubert calculus, in matroid theory, and other areas of combinatorics.
