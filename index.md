# About me

I'm a mathematician at the University of Oregon.  I work in algebraic and enumerative combinatorics.  A large part of my work involves combinatorics of the dimer model.  I have also done some work in the combinatorial side of Schubert calculus, in matroid theory, and other areas of combinatorics.
# CALICO

I am co-organizing [CALICO](https://pages.uoregon.edu/plhersh/CALICO/), the cascade lectures in combinatorics.  The sixth meeting of this lecture series will be held in Eugene, OR at the University of Oregon. Here are the beginnings of a page of [[local information for CALICO attendees]]  - maps, nearby hotels, nearby restaurants, directions to the airport, and so forth.
